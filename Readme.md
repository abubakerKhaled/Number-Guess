# Guess a Number Game

"Guess a Number" is a simple interactive game where either the user or the computer tries to guess a randomly selected number within a specified range. This README file provides an overview of the game mechanics, how to play, and the implementation of the code.

## How to Play

### User Guessing

In the user guessing game, the computer picks a random number between 1 and `x`, and the user has to guess what the number is. After each guess, the computer will provide feedback indicating whether the guess was too low, too high, or correct.

### Computer Guessing

In the computer guessing game, the user thinks of a number between 1 and `x`, and the computer tries to guess it. The user provides feedback after each guess to tell the computer whether the guess was too high, too low, or correct.
